Generalized TicTacToe
=====================

* To run:
    ```sh
    ./gradlew run
    ```

* To jar:
    ```sh
    ./gradlew jar
    ```
    This will create the `mnkgame.jar` file into the `./build/libs/` directory.

The syntax for the `.jar` program is:
    ```
    java -jar ./path/to/mnkgame.jar [-m <int>] [-n <int>] [-k <int>]
    ```

Default values for `m`, `n` and `k` is `3`.
